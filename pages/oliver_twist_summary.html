              Oliver Twist is born into a life of poverty and misfortune, raised in a workhouse in the fictional town of Mudfog.
            The children working there receive very little food; after six months, they draw lots, with the loser asking for 
            another portion of gruel. Oliver is designated, and so he approaches workhouse manager Mr. Bumble and humbly 
            requests another serving. A great uproar ensues at this perceived act of rebellion.

              Oliver is removed from the workhouse and sent into the service of undertaker Mr. Sowerberry. One day, clumsy
            co-apprentice Noah Claypole insults Oliver's mother and an enraged physical altercation ensues. Oliver runs away
            to London to seek a better life.

              Oliver falls in with an infamous criminal known as Fagin, who trains orphan boys as pickpockets. During his training,
            Oliver is apprehended by his intended victim, an old gentleman named Mr. Brownlow. Brownlow takes Oliver home and cares
            for him. As Oliver recovers, Brownlow and his housekeeper notice that Oliver resembles a woman depicted in a portrait
            hanging in Brownlow's home.

              Fagin sends a young woman named Nancy, and her abusive lover, the robber Bill Sikes, to bring Oliver back to Fagin's
            lair. Fagin forces him to participate in a burglary. The robbery goes wrong, and Oliver ends up under the care of the 
            people he was supposed to rob: Miss Rose and her guardian Mrs. Maylie.

              A mysterious relative of Oliver, known only as "Monks," teams up with Fagin, to prevent Oliver from learning of his past.
            Monks bribes Mr. Bumble and his new wife, the Widow Corney, for information on Oliver. Together, they dispose of a ring and
            medallion that once belonged to Oliver's mother. Nancy, racked with guilt for her role in Oliver's kidnapping, secretly spies
            on them and passes the information on to Rose Maylie, who tells Mr. Brownlow.

              Noah Claypole, who has since joined Fagin's gang, discovers that Nancy regularly meets with the Brownlows and Maylies for the
            sake of Oliver's welfare. Fagin passes the information on to Sikes, who beats Nancy to death in a fit of rage and goes into hiding.
            He is recognized by an angry mob and accidentally hangs himself in his attempt to escape.
            
              Mr. Brownlow forces Monks to divulge his secrets: he is Oliver's half-brother and had hoped to steal Oliver's half of their rightful
            inheritance. Brownlow begs Oliver to give half his inheritance to Monks and grant him a second chance, to which Oliver happily agrees.
            Monks emigrates to America, but squanders his money, relapses into crime, and dies in prison. Fagin is arrested and sentenced to the 
            gallows. The day before his execution, Oliver and Mr. Brownlow visit him in Newgate Prison. Rose Maylie, who turns out to be Oliver's
            maternal aunt, marries and enjoys a long life. Oliver lives happily with Mr. Brownlow as his adoptive son.
