              Jane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish.
            Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Jane's uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family
            who was kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children
            from associating with Jane. As a result, Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's
            only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an
            unhappy childhood. One day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds' only
            son, Jane is locked in the red room in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his
            ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the "ambiguous relationship between parents and children" which
            plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.[8] She is subsequently attended to by the
            kindly apothecary Mr Lloyd to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane
            should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed happily supports.

              At Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends
            an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session, her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails, and receives a
            lashing as a result. Later, Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells
            her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that
            she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges.

              After six years as a student and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of a new life, growing bored with
            her life at Lowood. Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married. Jane advertises her services as a
            governess in a newspaper. The housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane's advertisement. Jane takes the
            position, teaching Adèle Varens, a young French girl.

              Jane then receives word that Mrs Reed has suffered a stroke and is calling for her. Jane returns to Gateshead Hall and remains there
            for a month to tend to her dying aunt. Mrs Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth a letter from Jane's paternal
            uncle, Mr John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. Mrs Reed admits to telling Mr Eyre that Jane had died
            of fever at Lowood. Soon afterward, Mrs Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.

              Back at Thornfield, Jane broods over Mr Rochester's rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However, one midsummer evening,
            Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him. The normally
            self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him. Rochester then is sure that Jane is sincerely in love with him, and he
            proposes marriage. Jane is at first skeptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal. She then writes to her Uncle
            John, telling him of her happy news.

              It turns out that Jane's uncle, Mr John Eyre, is a friend of Mr Mason's and was visited by him soon after Mr Eyre received Jane's
            letter about her impending marriage. After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south
            of France and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. Jane is tempted but realises that she will
            lose herself and her integrity if she allows her passion for a married man to consume her, and she must stay true to her Christian
            values and beliefs. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for Rochester, Jane leaves Thornfield Hall at dawn
            before anyone else is up.
            
              Jane reunites with Rochester, and he is overjoyed at her return, but fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. "Am I hideous,
            Jane?", he asks. "Very, sir; you always were, you know", she replies. Now a humbled man, Rochester vows to live a purer life, and reveals
            that he has intensely pined for Jane ever since she left; he even called out her name in despair one night (the very call that she heard
            from Moor House), and heard her reply from miles away, signifying the connection between them. Jane asserts herself as a financially
            independent woman and assures him of her love, declaring that she will never leave him; Rochester proposes again, and they are married.
            They live blissfully together in an old house in the woods called Ferndean Manor. The couple stay in touch with Adèle as she grows up,
            as well as Diana and Mary, who each gain loving husbands of their own. St John moves to India to accomplish his missionary goals, but
            is implied to have fallen gravely ill there. Rochester regains sight in one eye two years after his and Jane's marriage, enabling him
            to see their newborn son.
