            &emsp; <strong><i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i></strong> is one of two novels (the other being Barnaby Rudge) which Charles Dickens published along <br>
            with short stories in his weekly serial Master Humphrey's Clock, from 1840 to 1841. It was so popular that New York readers <br>
            stormed the wharf when the ship bearing the final instalment arrived in 1841. The Old Curiosity Shop was printed in book form <br>
            in 1841. The plot follows the life of Nell Trent and her grandfather, both residents of The Old Curiosity Shop in London.
