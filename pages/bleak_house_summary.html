              Sir Leicester Dedlock and his wife Honoria live on his estate at Chesney Wold. Lady Dedlock is a beneficiary under one of the
            wills. While listening to the reading by the family solicitor, Mr Tulkinghorn, of an affidavit, she recognises the handwriting
            on the copy. The sight affects her so much she almost faints, which Mr Tulkinghorn notices and investigates. He traces the
            copyist, a pauper known only as "Nemo", in London. Nemo has recently died, and the only person to identify him is a
            street-sweeper, a poor homeless boy named Jo, who lives in a particularly grim and poverty-stricken part of the city
            known as Tom-All-Alone's ("Nemo" is Latin for "nobody").

              Esther Summerson is raised by the harsh Miss Barbary, who tells her "Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers".
            After Miss Barbary dies, John Jarndyce becomes Esther's guardian and assigns the Chancery lawyer "Conversation" Kenge to take
            charge of her future. After attending school for six years, Esther moves in with him at his home, Bleak House. Jarndyce
            simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards, Richard Carstone and Ada Clare (who are both his and one another's
            distant cousins). They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in Jarndyce and Jarndyce; their guardian is a
            beneficiary under another will, and the two wills conflict. Richard and Ada soon fall in love, but though Mr Jarndyce
            does not oppose the match, he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession.

              Lady Dedlock is also investigating the copyist, disguised as her maid, Mademoiselle Hortense. Lady Dedlock pays Jo to take
            her to Nemo's grave. Meanwhile, Mr Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock has a secret which could threaten the interests of
            Sir Leicester and he watches her constantly, even enlisting her maid to spy on her. He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run
            Jo out of town, to eliminate anything that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks.

              Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and talks with her later at Chesney Wold. Lady Dedlock discovers that Esther is her own
            child: unknown to Sir Leicester, before she married Honoria had had a lover, Captain Hawdon (Nemo), and bore a daughter by
            him, who she had believed was dead. The daughter, Esther, was brought up by Honoria's sister, Miss Barbary.

              Esther becomes sick (possibly with smallpox, since it severely disfigures her) from the homeless boy Jo. Lady Dedlock waits
            until Esther has recovered before telling her the truth. Though Esther and Lady Dedlock are happy to be reunited, Lady Dedlock
            tells Esther they must never acknowledge their connection again.

              Upon her recovery, Esther finds that Richard, having failed at several professions, has ignored his guardian's advice and is
            trying to push Jarndyce and Jarndyce to conclusion in his and Ada's favour, and has fallen out with John Jarndyce. In the
            process, Richard loses all his money and declines in health. He and Ada have secretly married, and Ada is pregnant. Esther
            has her own romance when Mr Woodcourt returns to England, having survived a shipwreck, and he continues to seek her company
            despite her disfigurement. However, Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian, the much older John Jarndyce.

              Mademoiselle Hortense and Mr Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock's past. After a confrontation with Mr Tulkinghorn,
            Lady Dedlock flees her home, leaving a note apologising to Sir Leicester for her conduct. Mr Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense, who
            is no longer of any use to him. Mr Tulkinghorn is shot through the heart, and suspicion falls on Lady Dedlock. Sir Leicester,
            discovering his lawyer's death and his wife's confession and flight, suffers a catastrophic stroke, but he manages to
            communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return.
            
              Inspector Bucket, who has previously investigated several matters related to Jarndyce and Jarndyce, accepts Sir Leicester's
            commission to find Lady Dedlock. At first he suspects Lady Dedlock of the murder but is able to clear her of suspicion after
            discovering Hortense's guilt. He requests Esther's help to find her mother. Lady Dedlock has no way to know of her husband's
            forgiveness or that she has been cleared of suspicion, and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the
            cemetery of her former lover, Captain Hawdon (Nemo). Esther and Inspector Bucket find her there.
