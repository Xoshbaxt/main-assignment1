            &emsp; <strong><i>Gulliver's Travels, or Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World.</i></strong> In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, <br>
            First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships is a 1726 prose satire by the Anglo-Irish writer and clergyman <br>
            Jonathan Swift, satirising both human nature and the "travellers' tales" literary subgenre. It is Swift's best known <br>
            full-length work, and a classic of English literature. Swift claimed that he wrote Gulliver's Travels "to vex the world <br>
            rather than divert it".
