            &emsp; <strong><i>Bleak House</i></strong> is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a 20-episode serial <br>
            between March 1852 and September 1853. The novel has many characters and several subplots, <br>
            and is told partly by the novel's heroine, Esther Summerson and partly by an omniscient narrator. <br>
            At the centre of Bleak House is a long-running legal case in the Court of Chancery, Jarndyce and <br>
            Jarndyce, which comes about because a testator has written several conflicting wills.
