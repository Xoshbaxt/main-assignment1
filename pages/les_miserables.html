            &emsp; <strong><i>Les Misérables</i></strong> is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered <br>
            one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. Les Misérables has been popularized through numerous adaptations <br>
            for film, television and the stage, including a musical.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp; In the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title. However, several <br>
            alternatives have been used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched <br>
            Poor, The Victims, and The Dispossessed. Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the <br>
            novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and <br>
            his experience of redemption.
