              The story begins in 1815 in Digne, as the peasant Jean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in the Bagne of
            Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned
            away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.

              Digne's benevolent Bishop Myriel gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police
            capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks
            as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his life
            has been spared for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.

              Six years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of
            Montreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one
            volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages
            to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector Javert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon
            during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has
            known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.

              Fantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try to meet
            their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory, because of the
            discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In
            desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine
            is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.

              A dandy named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to
            be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine)
            intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory
            turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.

              Javert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French
            authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean,
            have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose
            real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see
            Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.

              After Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette
            is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. 
            Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper,
            kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.

              Valjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life.
            While imprisoned in the Bagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging.
            Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities
            report him dead and his body lost.

              Valjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her
            to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters Éponine and
            Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an
            expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier
            is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and
            lodging.

              The next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately
            accepts, while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays
            the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after
            them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette
            without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette.
            Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did
            not bring his gun and turns back toward home.

              Valjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However,
            Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from Javert. They
            soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once rescued from being
            crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and Cosette becomes a student
            at the convent school.

              At the Luxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to
            Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname "Jondrette" at Gorbeau House (coincidentally,
            the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next
            door to the Thénardiers.

              The philanthropist and his daughter enter—actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing
            them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve
            her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The Thénardiers have also recognized
            Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid of the Patron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers
            and robbers.

            Marius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire
            one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine
            and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and
            he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught
            in a dilemma.

              He tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have
            never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He
            also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they would keep her with them until he delivers the
            money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette.
            Mme. Thénardier omes back alone, and announces the address is a fake.

              It is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about
            to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers' apartment through the
            wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be
            stopped by Javert.

              He arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (except Claquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison, and
            Montparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene
            before Javert sees him.

              After Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at "The Field of the Lark" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's
            address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and
            Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette and Brujon manage to escape
            from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night,
            during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's house. However, Éponine,
            who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves
            do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be
            leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.
            
              When Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg,
            a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires,
            fatally wounding the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the
            barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the
            barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.

              Marius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot
            for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies
            dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together.
            She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.

              Valjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect Marius
            or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche
            goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.

              Upon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly
            Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks to
            be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but
            when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he
            is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to
            the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing
            himself into the Seine.

              Thénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows
            of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of the good he has
            done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence.
            Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade.
            Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then confronts Thénardier with his crimes and offers
            him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes
            a slave trader.

              As they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean
            near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank
            slab in Père Lachaise Cemetery.
